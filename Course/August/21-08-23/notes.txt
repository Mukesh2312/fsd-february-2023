What is Nodejs?
1.Nodejs is run environment or compiler  for javascript to run outside the browser
2.All browser will support javascript 
js --> html - web page dynamic
What is Vanilla Js?
It is pure javascript with no third party functionality.
Framework:
//Already some set of functionality is given by default.
============================================
Where to write Javascript?
//Best approach is bottom of the page 
//Because html and CSS should be loaded first so UI will be presentable to users. 
//In some situation we need to add javascript in head tag where css has dependence with javascript.
Two ways of writing javascript 
1.internal 
2.external 
//external is best approach 
===================================================
HTML 
//It is written in the form of parent - child relationship 
//Tree data structure 
//Entire javascript is build using object 
//window object is attached to DOM
Object 
//It consists of properties and behaviour 
Person 
properties 
weight 
color 
height 
behaviour 
walk()
foodInTake()
sleep()
============================
Variable and Datatypes 
variable  - to create address so that we can store value in that address 
datatypes - It helps javascript to find the particular so that it can create particular set of space inside the memory.
===========================================
Datatypes is divided into two types:
1.primitive types 
   1.string - a set of character
   2.number  - it can be integer or floating point everything is number in javascript
   3.boolean 
   4.undefined
   5.Symbol - unique value
2.derived Types 
    1.Array 
    2.Object 
    3.Null
Javascript have dynamic datatype 
//typeof will help to find the datatype 
=====================
Arithmetic operator 
1.assignment operator (=)   
2.addition(+) 
3.subtraction(-) 
4.multiplication(*) 
5.division(/)  
6.modulo(%) 
7.increment(++) 
8.decrement(--)
shorthand operator 
+=
-=
/=
%=
Comparison operator 
//Final return value for comparison operator is boolean
1.double equality operator(==)  --> will compare only only
2. === -->will compare value + datatype
3. > 
4. >= 
5. < 
6. <= 
7. != 
8. !==
logical operator 
//final return value is boolean
1.&&
 -->both true it will return true
 -->anyone false it will return false 
 -->In case of zero instead of returning false it will return zero
 -->always start with negative condition on left side
2.|| 
  -->anyone true means it will give true result
  -->always start with positive condition on left side
3.!
true --> false 
==================================
