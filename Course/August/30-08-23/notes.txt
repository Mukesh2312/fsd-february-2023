Switch Statement:
//For decision making if we have multiple statement we can use this switch 
example:
switch(){
    case condition:
          //code 
          break;
    case condition:
          //code 
          break;
    default:
        //code
}
//We need to use break keyword after each case 
//If you have multiple statement inside the case no need of {} braces 
//If you writing inside the function you can use return keyword also in the place of break keyword.

//If you have condition inside the switch statement then make switch function to true and inside the case you can write the condition.
switch(true){
        case salary >=0 && salary <=5000:
             tax = salary * 0.1;
             break;
        default:
              console.log('nothing');
}
