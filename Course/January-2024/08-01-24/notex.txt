Nextjs
//It is framework to develop full stack application.
//Routing pattern is changed 
//serverside rendering of UI 
//we can write only reactjs by using nextjs 
//we can write both frontend and backend in one framework.
To setup nextjs in your local system:
npx create-next-app@latest project_name
Two types of routing mechanism:
1.App Routing 
main file --> src/app/page.js
2.Page Routing 
main file --> pages/index.js
//cmd:npm i
Running project 
cmd:npm run dev
=============================
Creating your own page routing:
Approach 1:
//create new folder inside the pages and inside that create one file with index.js 
example:
Pages 
    blog 
       index.js 
Approach 2:
//create direct files inside the pages folder 
example:
Pages 
   blog.js
