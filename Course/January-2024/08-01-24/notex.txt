Nextjs
//It is framework to develop full stack application.
//Routing pattern is changed 
//serverside rendering of UI 
//we can write only reactjs by using nextjs 
//we can write both frontend and backend in one framework.
To setup nextjs in your local system:
npx create-next-app@latest project_name
Two types of routing mechanism:
1.App Routing 
main file --> src/app/page.js
2.Page Routing 
main file --> pages/index.js
//cmd:npm i
Running project 
cmd:npm run dev
=============================
Creating your own page routing:
Approach 1:
//create new folder inside the pages and inside that create one file with index.js 
example:
Pages 
    blog 
       index.js 
Approach 2:
//create direct files inside the pages folder 
example:
Pages 
   blog.js 
=================================================
How to create Dynamic routing inside Page router?
//create one folder inside that we need to create file name with arraybracket 
example:
pages 
    blogs 
        [id].js 
======================================================
How to access dynamic routing params inside the application 
//we need to import useRouter package from next/router 
//Inside that package we have query parameter to access that data 
example:
import {useRouter} from 'next/router';

function PostDetails(){
    const router = useRouter();
    const{id} = router.query;
}
================================

1.Entire routing system is changed. It is filed based.
2.Giving link to another page we need to use from next/link package.
3.Creating dynamic routes we need to follow steps given by next 
4.Importing dynamic routes parameter we need to use next/router
