Types of selectors
Basic Selector 
1.element selector - it will target the particular element
2.class selector - it helps for grouping
3.id selector - it will target unique element
4.grouping selector - it will group (class,id,element) together to apply common css 
5.universalselector - it will apply to the elements

Combinator Selector - relationship between two tags 
1.descendant (space) - parent/child/grandchild - (larger area)
2.child (>) - parent/child
3.adjacent siblings (+)  brother/sister/first tags
4.general siblings (~)  brother/sister/all tags (larger area)

Pseudo-elements 
1.before (::before) - it will add content from css to html before the text of that particular tag
2.after (::after) - it will add content from css to html after the text.
3.selection (::selection) - it is use to highlight the content of web page.

Pseudo-class 

1.Psuedo-class-basic- (mainly in input tag)
    1.focus - (input:focus)
    2.required - (input:required)

2.Pseudo-class-anchor - (mainly in anchor tag)
       1.link - (a:link) - newly link elements
       2.active - (a:active) - once you press the mouse
       3.visited -(a:visited) - already you visited the page
       4.hover - (a:hover) - mouse over

3.Psuedo-class-general - (mostly used in li tags)
      1.first-child - (li:first-child) - first element in the list will have the impact
      2.nth-child - (li:nth-child(2n))
             2n - even number 
             2n+1 - odd number
      3.nth-of-type - both nth-child and nth-of-type will work in same way 
         //nth-child - will consider all siblings as their own element and it will you the wrong result.
         //nth-of-type - always it will consider the exact siblings element
      4.nth-last-child - (li:nth-last-child(2n)) - opposite of nth-child
