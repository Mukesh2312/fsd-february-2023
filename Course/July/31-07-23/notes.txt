Notes:
wrap - It will divide into multiple lines 
nowrap -It will continue in the same line 
order - whichever element you are going to select that is zero base 
       //if you want to move left direction we need to use -1 
       //if you want to move right direction we need to use 1
justify-content - working in horizental way
align-items - working in vertical way
align-self - It is similar to align-items - It will target only one element at a time.
