Flex Box:
display:flex;
flex-direction:row|row-reverse|column|column-reverse 
flex-wrap:wrap|nowrap:wrap-reverse
order:0|1|-1|-2
justify-content:flex-start|flex-end|space-between|space-evenly|center
align-item -center|end|baseline
align-self -center|end|baseline
flex-direction - row|column|row-reverse|column-reverse
align-content-center|base:baseline
Notes:
baseline- default starting position
wrap - It will divide into multiple lines 
nowrap -It will continue in the same line 
order - whichever element you are going to select that is zero base 
       //if you want to move left direction we need to use -1 
       //if you want to move right direction we need to use 1
justify-content - working in horizental way
align-items - working in vertical way
align-content - working in similar way to align-items.Only one difference we need to flex-wrap:wrap then only it will work.
align-self - It is similar to align-items - It will target only one element at a time.
