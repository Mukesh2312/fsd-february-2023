Difference between Synchronous and asynchronous.
Synchronous : line by line execution 
asynchronous : First come first serve 
example:
setTimeout 
//It will get trigger in particular set of time.
//1000 milliseconds is equal to 1 seconds
example:
 setTimeout(function(){
         alert("alarm is ringing");
    },3000)
setInterval
//every 3seconds it will get executed.
 setInterval(function(){
         alert("alarm is ringing");
    },3000)
